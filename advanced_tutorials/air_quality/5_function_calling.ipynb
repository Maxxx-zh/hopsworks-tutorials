It slightly improved to 9.7 by the 19th, indicating relatively clean air that would be quite suitable for outdoor activities. There was a slight uptick in pollutants midweek, with air quality readings reaching 15.6 and 16.7 on the 20th and 21st respectively, suggesting a decrease in air quality but still remaining within a range considered safe, although individuals with sensitivity to air pollution might have experienced some discomfort. The air quality then improved significantly towards the end of the week, dropping to very good levels of 8.7 on the 22nd, 5.4 on the 23rd, and 6.4 on the 24th, indicating cleaner air and ideal conditions for spending time outdoors.\n"
